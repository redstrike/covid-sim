# Covid19 Simulation (Rust/WASM tutorial example app)

This is toy project created for the article “[Rust Tutorial: An Introduction to Rust for JavaScript Devs](https://www.sitepoint.com/rust-tutorial-introduction-javascript-devs)” about Rust in the browser.

It simulates the infection in a population represented by a grid of simple `<div>` that change color based on their health.

This is not meant to be an accurate simulation in any sense. It may be fun to play around with different numbers.
But really, the app only exists as an example app to help people learn about using Rust in the browser.
